Course: 2IOA0 Q4 2024

Welcome to our web-based programming environment made expecially for people with ADHD: CalmCoder.

Make sure you have the extention "Live Server" installed by Ritwick Dey. All of the files 
and programs that were mentioned in the course (like python, xampp, etc.) should 
be properly installed as well. 

To start the webpage please open the 'index.html' file 
(blockly > apps\blocklyduino > index.html). Right mouse click and press 
'Open with Live Server'. The webpage will now be launched. 

Please make sure the sound of your laptop is on to get the full experience of our application.

In the web-based environment you can find several new implementations that will help children
with ADHD.

The hint button
The first application is the 'Hint' button in the tab at the top of the page. Based on the use
case that the user is working on they will be able to get appropriate hints. First a very vague
hint will appear, but they will be able to click through to get hints that are clearer every time.
To illustrate the idea, we implemented a pop-up where the users choose the Use Case, and then a
pop-up where the user gets the hint. This pop-up includes the option to close it as well.

Homescreen
When you open CalmCoder, you see a homescreen. Here you can choose one of the two assignments. 
When pressing either one, you get a screen with all the seperate steps that need to be taken in 
order to fulfill the assignment. You can always go back to this screen by pressing the 'homescreen'
button at the top left of the program.

Check button
While programming, the check button can be pressed. The current code will now be compared to what
the code should look like. It checks for all the seperate steps that are described on the homescreen
and returns how far along they are in the assignment.

The progress bar
The progress bar is placed at the top of the screen. Whenever the user presses the check button the 
progress bar is updated. The percentage is adjusted and the bar will be filled with a green color
coherent to the percentage of the progress.

Upload button
When you click the upload button an uplifting sound will be played, and a pop-up will appear that 
tells the user it has done a good job!

Sounds
When you place a block that you need in the workspace, the user will hear a positive sound. When
the user places a block that is wrong they will hear a negative sound. This will give the user
the feedback and guidance that people with ADHD need. When pressing the check button, a positive sound
is played as well.
