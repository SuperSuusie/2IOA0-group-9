Welcome to our web-based programming environment made expecially for people with ADHD.

Make sure you have the extention "Live Server" installed by Ritwick Dey. All of the files 
and programs that were mentioned in the course (like python, xampp, etc.) should 
be properly installed as well. 

To start the webpage please open the 'index.html' file 
(blockly > apps\blocklyduino > index.html). Right mouse click and press 
'Open with Live Server'. The webpage will now be launched. 

Please make sure the sound of your laptop is on to get the full experience of our application

In the web-based environment you can find several new implementations that will help children
with ADHD.

The hint button
The first application is the 'Hint' button in the tab at the top of the page. Based on the use
case that the user is working on they will be able to get appropriate hints. First a very vague
hint will appear, but they will be able to click through to get hints that are clearer every time.
To illustrate the idea, we implemented a pop-up where the users choose the Use Case, and then a
pop-up where the user gets the hint. This pop-up includes the option to close it as well.

Upload button
When you click the upload button an uplifting sound will be played, and a pop-up will appear that 
tells the user it has done a good job!

The progress bar
There is currently only a placeholder, but on the bottom of the screen there is a progress bar. 
This will track how far along the user is in their process. There is already a function that can
easily adjust how far along the progress bar is, so further implementation will follow.

Sounds
When you place a block that you need in the workspace, the user will hear a positive sound. When
the user places a block that is wrong they will hear a negative sound. This will give the user
the feedback and guidance that people with ADHD need.
